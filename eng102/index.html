					<h2>Preface</h2>
					<div style="text-align: left; line-height: 42px;">
						<p style="text-indent: 60px;">In this anthology, the poems focus on the common theme</p>
						<p>
							of time. They are organized in order of an increasing acceptance of time. The beginning poems have a fearful attitude towards the passage of time, while the poems at the end accept the inevitability of time. Instead of worrying about growing old, they focus on making the most of life before it's too late.

						<h2>"Time Passes" - Joy Ladin (2015)</h2>
						<div style="text-align: left; line-height: 42px;">
							<p>Time too is afraid of passing, is riddled with holes</p>
							<p>through which time feels itself leaking.</p>
							<p>Time sweats in the middle of the night</p>
							<p>when all the other dimensions are sleeping.</p>
							<p>Time has lost every picture of itself as a child.</p>
							<p>Now time is old, leathery and slow.</p>
							<p>Can’t sneak up on anyone anymore,</p>
							<p>Can’t hide in the grass, can’t run, can’t catch.</p>
							<p>Can’t figure out how not to trample</p>
							<p>what it means to bless.</p>

						<h2>Analysis</h2>
						<div style="text-align: left; line-height: 42px;">
							<p style="text-indent: 42px;">In "Time Passes", Joy Ladin takes a different approach to describing time. Instead of time being described as a cold, unfeeling constant of life, time is personified with human feelings and emotions. She gives time human qualities, such as fear and longing. Time is described as an aging human being that is feeling the effects of time as life progresses. The poem depicts the life of time, with the beginning of the stanza focusing more on earlier life. At the start of the poem, time is portrayed as “afraid of passing” and “… sweats in the middle of the night.” Time is afraid of growing old and is in a constant state of fear about losing its abilities, which are described in the final lines of the poem. At the end of the stanza, time has finally grown old and is nostalgic about the old days, where they were far more athletic and nimble.</p>

						<div style="text-align: left; line-height: 42px;">
							<p style="text-indent: 42px;">
								"As Time Passes" explains the regret that many people feel towards the ends of their lives. Instead of positively remembering their old memories, Bivens emphasizes the darker, regretful side of people’s memories. She talks about how many people look back on their lives with a longing to return to their childhood. Sometimes, they wish that they could go back and change some of their actions, to better their life or correct a mistake that forever haunts their conscience. In addition, “As Time Passes” discusses the desire of some to leave a legacy behind in the line, “You hope they forget-me not...” But towards the end of the poem, Bivens gives them the advice to “Live on…” Instead of constantly thinking back about earlier moments in time, they should rather look ahead at the new moments not yet experienced. They should create new memories for themselves and keep enjoying every second of their lives until they cannot anymore.

							The song "Race With Time", by Hi-Rez, explains the constant hard work that Hi-Rez is doing, and his struggles to succeed in this cold world. Everyone else is doubting his skills and abilities, but Hi-Rez believes that he can prove them wrong with hard work and dedication. Many of his nights are restless, as he spends every moment possible working on his music and getting better at rapping. He is in a “race with time” because he can only be in the spotlight for so long, and is struggling to make it while he is still young. However, his constant focus on improvement is taking up irreplaceable years of his life. Later in the song, he explains how he hopes that he made the right career decision because it is too late to turn back now. After all his hard work and constant grinding, he lost many old friends and notes the depression he faces.

							<p style="text-indent: 42px;">
								Anxhelo Llangozi stresses how important it is to spend your time wisely in “A Poem About Time.” He argues that “Having the time of your life will always be worth it” and that “To waste your time is to be a fool.” Time is a constant, unchanging force that dictates life. In “A Poem About Time”, opposing qualities are a significant focus, with each stanza describing a contrast. For example, in the first stanza, Llangozi discusses the contradiction of how time can be both fast and slow, while remaining a constant force in life. In addition, he also describes the opposing qualities of people, with some enjoying the things that others dislike. Some people enjoy wasting time, while others absolutely despise it. Some people are forced to pay for their mistakes with jail, while others only waste time with anger from a failure. In the final lines of the poem, he goes on to say that, no matter what someone does in life, time will always go on.

						<h2 style="font-size: 34px;">"Time" - Erin Friedrichs (Mar 2010)</h2>
						<div style="text-align: left; line-height: 24px;">
							<p style="font-size: 18px;">The question that is asked the most; we hear it everyday,</p>
							<p style="font-size: 18px;">"What time Is it?" they want to know, and then they go away.</p>
							<p style="font-size: 18px;">It's time for bed, it's time for work, or time to feed the fishes, </p>
							<br>
							<p style="font-size: 18px;">It's time to take your medicine, or wash and dry the dishes.</p>
							<p style="font-size: 18px;">Time in seconds, time in hours, so many freckles past a hair,</p>
							<p style="font-size: 18px;">depending on the zone, or whether daylights savings there.</p>
							<p style="font-size: 18px;">Time is measured many ways from minutes to months,</p>
							<p style="font-size: 18px;">Time is what keeps everything from happening at once!</p>
							<br>
							<p style="font-size: 18px;">A time to live, a time to die, a time for having fun, </p>
							<p style="font-size: 18px;">Clocks and calenders alike, all scheduled by the sun.</p>
							<p style="font-size: 18px;">Intervals that cant be hurried, will not be denied,</p>
							<p style="font-size: 18px;">a season that we know that's coming, as surely as the tide.</p>
							<br>
							<p style="font-size: 18px;">If there ever comes a time when time will be no more,</p>
							<p style="font-size: 18px;">I wonder how we'll know to quit, or when it was before.</p>
							<p style="font-size: 18px;">Do we hurry? Do we loaf? It depends upon the time...</p>

						<h2>Analysis</h2>
						<div style="text-align: left; line-height: 42px;">
							<p style="text-indent: 42px;">
								In Erin Friedrichs’ “Time”, she focuses on the relentless, never-ending passing of time. Humanity is constantly obsessed with time, whether we realize it or not. Time dictates a significant portion of people’s lives, which leads everyone to always ask “What time is it?” At some times, we work, while at other times we play. Time is an incredibly powerful entity, controlling when activities are performed and when people die. In the poem, clocks and calendars physically symbolize the continual passage of time and its everlasting existence. Friedrichs notes how these cannot be controlled, especially in the line, “Intervals that cant be hurried, will not be denied.” Seconds or minutes can never change speed or stop. In addition, he notes how they are scheduled by the sun, which is also an uncontrollable element of nature, like time. The sun always rises and sets in a predictable way, just as time always passes.

							<p style="font-size: 18px;">time is</p>

							<p style="text-indent: 42px;">
								In “time”, the poem explains the passage of time and how the aging process affects people. Each stanza is a different part of someone’s lifetime, from childhood up until the final years. We as humans have conquered many different things over the course of history, such as diseases and worldwide travel. However, aging is one thing that humanity has yet to prevent, and time is one of humanity’s most precious resources. Other resources, like gold and silver, can be purchased, albeit with substantial amounts of money, but time cannot. Time is the one thing that no matter how powerful or wealthy someone is, they cannot acquire any more of. In the poem, Hoelbling examines how in people in their later years begin to look back at their lives and contemplate about their time on Earth and their existence. As time seems to accelerate for them, they look back and recollect their memories, wondering about the true meaning of time.

						<div style="text-align: left; line-height: 42px;">
							<p style="text-indent: 42px;">
								The poem “Theif” discusses the time that two lovers spent in their relationship, and how one essentially “stole time” from the other. Van Doren recollects the time when her and her significant other kissed in a parking lot, which is an important memory for her. She was very happy during that moment and time seemed to stop when they were together because she notes how she lost time during their encounter. Her happiness for her lover was so intense that she began to lose track of time and only focused on them. However, her lost time could also be interpreted in a more negative way. The relationship could have ended badly, and Van Doren is remembering all the time that she wasted on her significant other. Instead of her losing track of time in the happiness of the moment, she could also be recalling her memory of all her wasted time.

						<h2>Analysis</h2>
						<div style="text-align: left; line-height: 42px;">
							<p style="text-indent: 42px;">
								In the poem “Time to time to time to”, Kody Dibble describes how one’s life is whatever they make of it. How someone choses to spend their time can have a huge impact on their later life and memories. As a senior, this poem speaks to me because my high school career is almost over and an entire new chapter of my life is almost beginning. Later in life, I may look back on my high school career and reminisce about old time. Back to a time when I had far less responsibilities and far less to worry about. However, as a senior, college is also about to begin, which will create even more memories if I use my time wisely. In the poem, the line “To silence the fears that make us” also speaks to me because Dibble is telling the reader to face your fears and live. Time is whatever a person makes of it, and if someone faces their fears, they could live a much happier life.

					<h2>Epilogue</h2>
					<div style="text-align: left; line-height: 42px;">
						<p style="text-indent: 60px;">
							The selected poems in this anthology detail the inevitable force of time, along with humanity's fear and eventual acceptance of it. Time is such an arbitrary measure, and yet it is in control of so many aspects of life. It controls everything from when activities are done, to the length of everyone's lives. Some of the poems in this collection exhibit a fearful attitude towards the passage of time, while the later ones focus only on making the most of life. They begin to recognize the certainty of time and no longer attempt to control it. Similar to how humans become wiser with age, as the anthology progresses, the poems begin to understand the uncontrollable nature of time and accept its passage.
